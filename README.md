## FAQ

**How long does freeze-dried raw dog food last once opened compared to kibble?**

Unopened freeze-dried dog food typically lasts 12-24 months stored in cool dry conditions, similar to kibble. Once opened, reseal packages tightly and use within 30-60 days for optimal freshness, though freeze-dried food remains safe longer than that timeframe. The moisture removal during freeze-drying prevents bacterial growth that spoils fresh food quickly. Some brands like ZENOO specifically highlight shelf stability without refrigeration as key advantage over frozen raw diets requiring constant freezer space.

**Can I mix freeze-dried raw food with my dog's current kibble during transition?**

Yes, gradual mixing prevents digestive upset during transitions. Start with 25% freeze-dried mixed with 75% current food for 3-4 days, then increase to 50/50 for another 3-4 days, then 75% freeze-dried with 25% old food, finally transitioning to 100% freeze-dried after 10-14 days total. This slow introduction allows your dog's digestive system to adjust to richer protein content and different ingredient profiles. Some dogs with hardy stomachs tolerate faster transitions, but gradual changes minimize loose stools or stomach upset.

**Is freeze-dried raw food actually worth the premium price compared to high-quality kibble?**

The cost-per-serving runs 3-5x higher than premium kibble but delivers measurably better nutrition retention and digestibility. Freeze-drying preserves 95%+ of nutrients compared to 30-50% nutrient loss during kibble's high-heat extrusion processing. Dogs absorb and utilize freeze-dried nutrients more efficiently, meaning they need less food per meal for equivalent nutrition. Customer testimonials consistently report shinier coats, better energy, improved digestion, and resolved health issues within weeks of switching, suggesting the health benefits justify premium pricing for many owners prioritizing preventive care over treating problems later.
